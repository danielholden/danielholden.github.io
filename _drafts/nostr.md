Nostr is a new protocol for exchanging notes, it came to my attention when [@jack](https://twitter.com/jack) [posted](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1602800290876588032?s=20&t=S9_C-vm_B5e6ROgfFj_Dbw) about it in relation to the Twitter drama and the need for a descentralised social media network.

In order to understand more I thought I'd dive in and see if I can interact via the protocol, here's some goals:

1. Connect to a relay
2. Setup a new user
3. Subscribe to [@jack's](https://twitter.com/jack) [posted](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1602800290876588032?s=20&t=S9_C-vm_B5e6ROgfFj_Dbw) public key: `npub1sg6plzptd64u62a878hep2kev88swjh3tw00gjsfl8f237lmu63q0uf63m`
4. Post a message
