title:  "Learning to Touch Type"
---

I've always wanted to learn to touch type, I have worked on computers since I was 12, I have a degree in Computer Science and have worked in IT all of my professional life.  I have always thought my typing speed was reasonable but I knew I was not typing 'properly', so as a 2021 New Year's Resolution I would like to learn to type 'properly'.

To start, I measured my current typing speed using [10 Fast Fingers](https://10fastfingers.com/), my results came out at 86 worlds per minute

The 85% accuracy seems pretty poor but I do spend a lot of my time hitting that delete (backspace) key on my keyboard.

86 words a minute is reasonable and could qualify me as close to professional, although I'm sure I'd need to improve my accuracy.  However, I typed those words using my own style which involves primarily the use of my index fingers flicking around the keyboard.

With my fingers placed on the 'home row'

I could barely type a single word without a mistake, using the [Typing Club](https://typingclub.com) I did the first program and scored a whopping 15 words per minute

There are 685 lessons on the [Typing Club](https://typingclub.com) site, with each program combining multiple lessons.  

My target for 2021 is to reach 100 words per minute, which feels quite a way off.  I will update / link this post as I progress.
